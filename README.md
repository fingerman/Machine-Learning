In that repo I demonstrate handling classical decision-making and classification Problems using common Machine Learning tools. 
Pythonian libraries are applied, basically numpy, sklearn, pandas, tensorflow and etc. The focus of this particular repo are the 
classical ML techniques (up to Neural Networks). I seek to handle not just model training, but also its improvement with Cross Validation,  Hypermarameter
Tuning via Grid Search and etc. The Porblems stated are:  

### 1. [Linear and Logistic Regression](https://github.com/fingerman/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Linear-and-Logistic-Regression.ipynb)    
Dataset: [Bank Marketing Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)  

### 2. [Support Vector Machines and Random Forests](https://github.com/fingerman/Machine-Learning/blob/master/ML-SVMs-Trees-RandomForest.ipynb)  
Dataset: [Bank Marketing Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)  


### 3. [Naive Bayes Classifiers, Decision Trees, Random Forests](https://github.com/fingerman/Machine-Learning/blob/master/ML-NaiveBayes-DecisionTrees-RandomForests.ipynb)  
Dataset: [Nursery Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/nursery)
